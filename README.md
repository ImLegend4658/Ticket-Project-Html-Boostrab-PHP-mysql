# Ticket-Project-Html-Boostrab-PHP-mysql

Hello eveyone. 


I made small website about ticket that has uniqe user has own ticket and cant see other user's ticket. 

Only admin or IT support can see the ticket. 

For this project, I made this because i was learning backend website PHP with mysql to make it dynamic. 

This website is not complete it yet but you can edit it or complete it on your own way. 

Also, you can use it for project if you want because it's free. 

however, website cant be seen content unless user login. for example picture show in here.

Also, as i said, each user has sessions which is cant see other ticket unless he/she admin. 

For example, Khalid is user and Ahmad is user. 

Khalid cant see Ahmad's ticket unless Khalid is admin or IT support officer. 
here's example from user number 1.

user number 2:

as you see, saud cant see other tickt's users. only his;

Also, i didnt make admin panle yet but when i am done with it. i will update this for sure. 

here's three users and you can test it if you wnat or you can chage this from database.
Aziz@gmail.com
K@gmail.com

Also, make sure you fix the path too because my path is different then yours and website will be broken. 

Best,
